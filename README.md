<p align="center"><b>Background</b></p>


Hi, i'm Dimitri, and this is a large corpus of programs that I have created over the years. I first ever saw code in middle school when Scratch was introduced, a type of block coding. I became so obsessed with it, I had to do more. In 2020 (tenth grade), I did a class called Game Programming where they teached python and made fun games. Following year I did Computer Science 1 which was in javascript, and now in 2023, i'm a TA for Computer Science 1. 

To give an idea of where Im at, heres a list of some programming languages I have coded in, javascript, typescript, CSS, HTML, Java, Python, and Swift UI. Currently, javascript is my strongest coding language I have learned

Below are live links to my projects through the IDE, Codehs. The link to the right of each is its path in case there is any trouble finding its source location.
